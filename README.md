# Multi-robot_simulation
A simulation of multi-robot simulation using C#. This project mainy has 3 features:

        (1) use dynamic A* path planning for each robot
        (2) use priority structure to avoid robot-robot & robot-obstacle collision
        (3) task destination allocation based on path distance prediction
